This C project is built to find **text similarities between two files**. What it actually does is it *scans two file* you give as input and *outputs the similar words*.

But what do I mean by telling similar words? Actually it firstly outputs *the words involved in both files*. And secondly, it *outputs 2-grams* which means contiguous sequence of 2 items involved in both files.

If you are reading this file, most probably you know how to compile this C program and execute it. But if you don't know it, I have a *Wiki page* for you to be with US. **Visit it**.
